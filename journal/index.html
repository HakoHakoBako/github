        <h3>What are the best practices for modals?</h3>
        <time datetime="2026-01-29">January 29, 2026</time>

        <p> This medium article discusses the best practices of modals, or known as overlays and dialog windows at other times. Modals sits on the top of a page and block any interaction with the page’s main content. It remains blocked until the user interacts with it.</p>

        <p>Common usages with modals are to capture user attention, needing user inputs, and showing additional information in context. However, it’s not recommended to use modals to show error, success, or warning messages.</p>

        <p>Good modal practices include various methods. One key practice is providing a user a way to escape the modal window, such as a close, escape, or cancel button. Another practice is to make sure the modal uses descriptive titles so that users know what it’s used for. It is also to make sure the content should neither be too big or small; ensuring context is sufficient and located above the screen is just as important.</p>

        <p>Modals can be beneficial, but sometimes a hindrance to the user. While it provides benefits to getting user attention and simplifying context, it can also distract the user. Content is hidden by the modal, which disrupts the user’s flow as they’re unable to interact with the main content of the page. While modals may not always be best practice, depending on its usage, it could be used effectively.</p>
