      <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis Part Two</h2>
      <h3>Analyzing images</h3>
      <time datetime="2026-02-12">February 12, 2026</time>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/dimoo.png" alt="every picture my own image">
        <figcaption>Fig. Nathan Salas, Feb. 2026</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The image above is from a collection of toys/figures I collect from a series called Dimoo. What makes this image interesting is that each character has unique physical aspects. While the same character is being depicted, each iteration has something unique. Take for example, the third figure has a tree motif. But when you look closer, there is a moss-like texture on the figurine.</p>

      <p>As previously stated, this image shows the collection of toys that I collect. On a surface level, this reveals that I like to collect figures that have unique themes but are also cute in appearance. There are aspects of it that look very lively and put me in a good mood when I look at them. While simultaneously, I'm also a consumer and I like the consumption of buying such figures from blind boxes.</p>

      <p>However, if I wanted to make my images more visually compelling and narrative focused, I have some ideas. One idea could be placing them beside my school works. What I would want to communicate is that these figures help make my world more lively and positive. Especially when I'm constantly stressed from academics, these figures help to ground me in ways that calm and add liveliness to my mood.</p>

      <p>Another idea I have is to take pictures of my figures that would reveal a part of my own personality. For example, from the image above, there is one figure that is sleeping in snow. What I want to communicate is that I love sublimity and nature as the figure best presents that aspect. Each figure can represent a different part of my own personality and what makes me whole.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/everypictureshare.png" alt="every picture share session">
        <figcaption>Fig. Pachia Yang, Feb. 2026</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The image was shared by Pachia Yang. When I first looked at the image, one of my main assumptions was that she seemed to value fun.</p>

      <p>What made me infer that idea is that she has some mini plastic shot cups that seem to have names on them. To me, they're perhaps names of her friends. I would assume playing shot games is something she likes when having fun with her friends.</p>

      <p>At the same time, I was curious about the other objects within the background, such as the paper napkins. To me, I found it mysterious. Based on my previous inferences, something that I suggested was to maybe change the background or composition of the photo.</p>

      <p>If the narrative she wants to communicate involves having fun with her friends, she could potentially include them holding the cups. Or she can replace some objects in the image to better reflect a fun narrative — this could be through including larger size cups or drinks.</p>

      <h2>Visual Thinking</h2>
      <h3>How does visual thinking improve one's skills?</h3>
      <time datetime="2026-02-10">February 10, 2026</time>

      <a href="https://shorturl.at/v0Obk" rel="visualthinkingarticle">NYT Article Link</a>

      <p>The NYT article discusses ways people can practice and engage their visual thinking skills with the photos they view. Viewing photos and interpreting them can be a fun exercise to many. However, it can also serve as a crucial part in developing how you pay attention to fine details.</p>

      <p>Practicing regularly to analyze and observe details within photos can further develop skills in making connections. It encourages people to critically think as to what exactly is going on in a photo, or really any visual and written text given.</p>

      <a href="https://shorturl.at/uw6Re" rel="whatmatters">What Matters Agency Link</a>

      <p>One website link that I found is one connected to an agency called What Matters. Their website and agency provides social media marketing services for hospitality groups and service-based businesses. What I found really intriguing is the use of the website’s photography — many photos are professionally edited and tell a story behind them.</p>

      <p>One example being the agency worked on marketing Sydney Fish Market; their use of photography and short form videos are professionally made to attract locals, tourists, and seafood lovers alike. Seeing the works the agency does inspires me to deliver high quality goods and services to others.</p>

      <h2>Modals</h2>
      <h3>What are the best practices for modals?</h3>
      <time datetime="2026-01-29">January 29, 2026</time>

      <p>This Medium article discusses the best practices of modals, also known as overlays or dialog windows. Modals sit on top of a page and block interaction with the page’s main content until the user interacts with them.</p>

      <p>Common usages with modals are to capture user attention, require user input, and show additional information in context. However, it’s not recommended to use modals to show error, success, or warning messages.</p>

      <p>Good modal practices include providing users a way to escape the modal window, such as a close, escape, or cancel button. Another practice is to ensure the modal uses descriptive titles so users know its purpose. It is also important to make sure the content is neither too big nor too small and remains visible within the screen.</p>

      <p>Modals can be beneficial but sometimes a hindrance to the user. While they help capture attention and simplify context, they can also disrupt the user’s flow since the main content becomes inaccessible.</p>

      <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <time datetime="2026-01-19">January 19, 2026</time>

      <p>This Medium article discusses best practices to follow when designing form pages. For any website or mobile application, the ultimate goal is to encourage users to engage with the application.</p>

      <p>A highly critical concept to make forms effective is not making them complex. This can be done through different UX design choices such as showing the number of steps through a progress bar.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, most people don’t like filling out forms. That is why it’s best practice for designers to make forms easily accessible and straightforward.</p>

      <p>Fast Retailing is a good example of well-designed forms. When applying for jobs, there is a provided progress bar as well as labels above the input fields.</p>
