       // My program prompts the user to answer a question about how they're feeling. Since it's a bad feeling, the program generates a list from 1-100. The list has two phrases to cheer them up. But the whole idea is that the program is awkward at cheering the user up, making it a funny encounter.
       // var feeling = prompt("Hey! How are you today? (type something negative)", ""); is the sequence
