                <p>This is a picture of one of my figures that I collect. It's called Dimoo and it's part of the Animal Kingdom Collection. I specifically chose the penguin figure because it reveals my favorite animal, penguins! I find penguins to be super adorable!</p>

                <p>I further chose the penguin because I love the outfit. I love the hat, bowtie, honestly..the entire outfit is super classy. And the figure looks to be dancing with the penguin as well. How adorable is that?! The colors also remind me of coffee shops, which I also love just as much!</p>

                <p>This is a picture of one of my figures that I collect. It's called Pinot Jelly and it's part of the Star Project Series. I specifically chose the figure because one thing and one thing only. Coffee. The figure is holding my favorite beverage.</p>

                <p>If you clicked on the orange figure previously, I mentioned that I love coffee! Coffee is my favorite beverage of all time. I love Lattes, Americano, Cold Brew, etc etc. I love eating sweets and desserts, and coffee is the perfect drink to wash it all down. Such a nice flavor profile. It might not be to everyone's taste, but oh well. It fits my taste.</p>

                <p>This is a picture of the mascot of my favorite K-Pop group of all time: Seventeen! The mascot of Seventeen is called Bong Bongie. To be honest….I'm not sure what it's supposed to be. I think it's supposed to be based on Seventeen's motif of diamonds. It also uses colors from Seventeen's branding of Serenity Blue and Serenity Pink?</p>

                <p>I chose Bong Bongie because I love Seventeen. As they're my favorite K-Pop group, I collect a lot of their merchandise. My favorite merchandise is the plush keychain of Bong Bongie, super cute!!</p>

                <p>This is a picture of…me? Oh it's me! I'm not a figure, I'm real! I put a picture of myself to represent who I am! As you may notice with the other figures, they're all wearing outfits corresponding to the figures I collect! But with these figures, I like to show who I am! Also because I wanted to show off my figure collection.</p>

                <p>If you didn't know this as well, but I chose the figures/plushes based on parts of my personality and my favorite things that I like about myself! Each figure represents a part of who I am as Nathan. I have a lot of figures that could represent me, the possibilities are endless! But I hope each figure tells you something different and a little bit about me!</p>

                <p>This is a picture of one of the figures I collect. It's called Dimoo and it's part of the Stories in the Cup collection. The figure I chose is…I'm not sure what the name is. Fun fact, I collected every figure from that Stories in the Cup collection! It was difficult for me to choose my favorite figure to be quite frank. They're all so unique and different, but I decided to choose the one in the picture!</p>

                <p>Why did I choose this? I like nature and greenery! Ultimately, I prefer living in the city and I'm a city boy. But every once in a while, I like to connect with nature. I love going on walks whenever I can, especially with friends. I think this figure exemplifies traits of sublimity and nature well. I love the peacefulness of nature walks! Also I chose it because it has a mossy texture on the figure</p>

                <p>This is a picture of a plush from one of my favorite Japanese manga and TV series called Chiikawa. I love Chiikawa because it's so cute with the mascots and characters. The series explores the characters and glimpses of their life and unique personalities. The particular plush and mascot I chose is called Hachiware! He is supposed to represent a blue cat. What I love about Hachiware is simply because he's blue! Blue is one of my favorite colors.
</p>

                <p>In this particular keychain, Hachiware is wearing a lavender themed outfit carrying a bouquet of lavender flowers! Lavender is my other favorite color! I love purple colors! I got this keychain from Japan, which is part of my cultural identity. I visited a flower farm with my family and lavenders are famous in the farm! As soon as I saw the Hachiware Keychain, I knew I had to grab it!</p>
